processing 13
i have created this small game using a processing 13, it is a fairly new lanaguage and easy to understand with various features for visual work.
feature and working of the game-
1. on starting the game ,2 numbers have to be genrated.
2. a player is available and several checkpoints have been made .
3. a button is designed, if pressed it displays two values
4. One of the value is sum of the two randomly generated value and other is random garbage.
5.  if you keep your cursor on the correct value the player moves and reaches the next checkpoint.
6.  and so on, after the last checkpoint game finishes.
